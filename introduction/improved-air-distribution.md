### Improved air distribution 

In addition to the thermal comfort benefits of increased air speeds,
ceiling fans can also improve air distribution, working in concert with
the HVAC system to provide the desired thermal conditions more
consistently throughout a space. When correctly designed and operated,
ceiling fans support the HVAC system to minimize temperature gradients
within a space, providing more consistent temperature and air quality
conditions throughout a space. This improved air distribution can be
effective for both heating and cooling scenarios. For example, ASHRAE
Standard 62.1 -- Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality lists a
ventilation effectiveness of 0.8 for ceiling-supplied warm air systems
(due to stratification of the warm air near the ceiling), but adding
ceiling fans in this scenario brings the ventilation effectiveness back
to 1.0, or fully mixed condition, reducing the amount of outside air
required.
