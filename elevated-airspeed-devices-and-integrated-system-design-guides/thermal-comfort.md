# Thermal comfort

Simply stated, thermal comfort is an occupant's satisfaction ("comfort")
with the perceived temperature ("thermal sensation") of their
environment. For centuries, humans have been using fans to help regulate
thermal comfort. The reason for this is simple: in warm conditions there
is generally less heat lost from the skin than in cooler conditions, and
so people are at risk of warming up (the science of thermal comfort is
described in more detail below). Increased air movement across the skin
carries away more heat from the body (via convection and evaporation),
and thereby restores comfort. Since the advent of mechanical HVAC
systems, building designers have largely focused on a single factor of
thermal comfort: air temperature. However, modifying other factors of
thermal comfort, such as air speed, changes how a particular air
temperature is perceived. Occupants near a ceiling fan will feel cooler
than they would at the same temperature in still air, similar to the
phenomenon of "wind chill", though the wind chill index is typically
used for higher air speeds and colder temperatures than occur indoors.
Similarly, when the air temperature is warmer, occupants near a fan will
feel more comfortable than they would in still air conditions.
