# Fan options and considerable metrics

There are multiple fan types available in the market, but ceiling fans in general out-weigh its benefits over other fan types due to its air circulation effectiveness and low energy consumption, especially for serving multiple occupants within the same space. In addition, installation and operation of ceiling fans are specific to building design which is different from other portable fan options. This guide highlights a standalone section on ceiling fans, while other fan choices (i.e., other air movement devices) will be discussed in separate section. Fans are really cool ([Cheung et al, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.01.014))

## Ceiling fans

The US Department of Energy (DOE) defines a variety of ceiling fan types in the "Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Ceiling Fans". Table T1 presents the criteria of ceiling fan blade thickness and tip speed adopted from DOE, and Table T2 summarizes the definition of several common ceiling fan types with supporting remarks.

In general, a larger diameter fan (i.e., high volume low speed (HVLS) fan) blade can move a larger volume of air than a smaller diameter fan blade. As fan diameter increases, rotational speed is typically limited to prevent excessive noise from the fan blades, especially near the blade tip. Additionally, where fans can be mounted at blade heights below 3 m \[10 ft], the rotational speed must be limited to meet safety criteria for the maximum speed of the blade tips. HSLV fans require higher ceilings (typically at least 3.3 m \[11 ft]) and larger spaces free from obstructions to accommodate their increased diameter, and these fans are most often found in non-residential stings, like commercial and industrial applications. Some large-diameter ceiling fans include “winglets” or blade tip fences to maximize airflow and minimize noise, which is a less common problem in standard fans as the blade tip speed is already constrained for safety reasons.

### Fan blades <a href="#_toc401145334" id="_toc401145334"></a>

Blade shape, number of blades, and blade pitch are important factors in increasing energy efficiency while maximizing airflow through the fan blades. In general, there are two main types of fan blades: flat blade and airfoil-style blade. The curvature of the airfoil blades helps increase airflow through the ceiling fan, minimizing air turbulence at the trailing edge, which it is more efficient and quieter when compared to flat blades. However, airfoil blades will not operate as efficiently (i.e., lower airflow) in reverse direction. Increasing number of fan blades and blade’s angle will increase the airflow of ceiling fan. Nevertheless, the increased weight and drag can cause energy efficiency loss. Standard ceiling fan typically have 3 to 5 blades with blade’s angle to be 8 – 15°.

### Motors and drives <a href="#_toc1444095927" id="_toc1444095927"></a>

Typically, ceiling fans have three main types of motor (AC induction; permanent magnet DC (PMDC); and brushless direct current (DC) motors), and two types of drives (direct drive; and gear-driven). Table T3 highlights the characteristics of these motors and drives.

They typically provide only three speed levels.                         |
| Permanent magnet DC (PMDC)    | More energy efficient than AC motors and provides constant force over a wider range of speeds than AC motors.                                          |                                                                                                                                         |

| Gear-driven                   | Gear-driven fans allow for higher motor power where maximizing airflow is a priority over sound levels or aesthetics.                                  |                                                                                                                                         |

## Diameter and rotational speed <a href="#_toc446846141" id="_toc446846141"></a>

Assume all other factors being equal, a larger diameter fan will produce greater airflow, average air speed, and uniformity of air speed in space than a smaller diameter fan at the same rotational speed. In general, the total airflow and the air speed form any measurement point are linear with rotational speed. This relationship begins to break down at very low air speed, very low rotational speeds, or where the fan blade height is unusually far from the floor.

## Rated airflow <a href="#_toc748789084" id="_toc748789084"></a>

The test methods for rating the airflow of these fans are regulated in the US under 10 CFR 430 Appendix U ([ref](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appU)). For standard fans, the rating is determined by a modified Energy Star method ([ref](https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod\_development/revisions/downloads/ceil\_fans/testmanual.pdf)), while for large diameter fans (above 2.1 m \[7ft]), the rating is determined by the AMCA 230-15 test method ([ref](https://www.techstreet.com/amca/standards/amca-230-15?product\_id=1904250)).
