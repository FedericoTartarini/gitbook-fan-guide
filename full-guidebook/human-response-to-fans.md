# Human response to fans

## Evidence of occupant’s preference for air movement <a href="#_heading-h.49x2ik5" id="_heading-h.49x2ik5"></a>

In theory, elevated air movement accelerates heat loss from occupants via convection and evaporation in a warm environment. The question is, do occupants appreciate elevated air movement? Or do the occupants prefer an environment with cooler temperatures than increased air speed? An experiment conducted in a climatic chamber in Singapore investigated occupants’ thermal acceptability under different temperature setpoints with and without fan operation. Figure 6 shows that occupants were thermally more acceptable at 26 °C \[79 °F] with higher air movement from personally controlled fans when compared with the condition at 23 °C \[73 °F] without a fan. Surprisingly, it also reported that the subjects found themselves thermally more acceptable with temperature at 29 °C \[84 °F] with a fan than at 23 °C \[73 °F] without a fan. These results revealed that the cooling strategy of only lowering the temperature setpoint might not sufficiently satisfy the occupants, while elevated air movement within the space can play a role in increasing thermal acceptability at higher temperature setpoints.

To validate the results from the experiment in a climatic chamber, a similar experiment has been conducted in a Singapore office building studying the occupants’ thermal acceptability and thermal preference responses under three conditions (23 °C \[73 °F] without a fan, and 26/27 °C \[79/81 °F] with fan). The study found similar higher thermal acceptability among the occupants for the environment at 26 and 27 °C \[79 and 81 °F] with elevated air speed than the condition at 23 °C \[73 °F] without fan operation. Besides, the occupants were overcooled and reported a preference for a warmer environment at 23 °C \[73 °F]. These results from a real building aligned with the findings obtained in the climatic chamber experiment, where both studies suggested that occupants in tropical climate regions preferred a warmer temperature with elevated air speed over an environment with a cooler temperature without sufficient air movement.

## Heat stress condition with air movement <a href="#_heading-h.2p2csry" id="_heading-h.2p2csry"></a>

Some health guidelines actively advise not to use a fan when indoor air temperatures exceed the skin temperature (\~ 35 °C \[95 °F]). Is it true that a fan shall not be used under heat-stress conditions? Using the human heat balance model, a study found that fans could potentially be used by a healthy young adult even if air temperature exceeds 35 °C \[95 °F], because elevated air speed through the human body increases sweat evaporation from the skin ([Tartarini et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321008325)). Figure 7 demonstrates under which conditions the fan use is beneficial regarding operative temperature and relative humidity. The green zone shows the environmental conditions in which the fan operating at V = 0.8 m/s \[160 fpm] is beneficial (i.e., providing additional cooling to the human body). The dark green zone represents the conditions where fan usage is still beneficial, but people are likely to suffer from heat strain. The red zone indicates the conditions under which fans are not beneficial and should not be used. The red line shows the temperature limit from WHO, which the usage of fans is not recommended. These findings indicate that fans could be used in some conditions to cool people even when the air temperature exceeds skin temperature. More human experiments and tests with non-healthy groups should be performed. If available and affordable, the use of air conditioning would guarantee safer conditions than just fans.
