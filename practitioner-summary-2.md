## Introduction <a href="#_toc1140000687" id="_toc1140000687"></a>

This guide enables engineers, architects, and facility managers to maximize the many benefits of fans and integrating fans (also known as elevated air movement devices) into HVAC systems. It introduces the advantages of using fans, describes how they work, explains how to select them, and provides guidance and resources for designing spaces with fans in buildings.

The key benefits of fans are as follows:

* Thermal comfort: Increased air movement across the skin remove heat from the body by convection and evaporation. Given the ability of some fans to provide more personalized thermal conditions, they can increase comfort.
* Improved air distribution: Operation of fans supports the HVAC system to increase air mixing, providing more uniform temperature and air quality distribution throughout a space in both heating and cooling conditions.
* Improved indoor air quality: Increased air speed may reduce an occupant’s exposure to indoor pollutants via dilution of the concentration of local sources, enhancement of the deposition rate of airborne particles onto indoor surfaces and increased ultraviolet germicidal irradiation system (UVGI) effectiveness for disinfection.
* Energy savings: Fans incur significant energy savings by reducing cooling demand of the HVAC system when the indoor temperature setpoints are increased. The HVAC savings potential is about two-orders of magnitude above the fan energy use.
* Cost savings: Beside the cost savings related to energy savings, using ceiling fans to distribute air more effectively throughout a space can reduce ductwork and diffusers required to serve a zone. Additionally, the higher temperature cooling setting allows HVAC system size reduction for chiller and air handling units, thus reducing the capital cost.

### How air speed meets thermal comfort goals <a href="#_toc618460869" id="_toc618460869"></a>

ASHRAE Standard 55 – Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy (2020) ([ref](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/standard-55-thermal-environmental-conditions-for-human-occupancy)) identifies six factors that affect thermal comfort, including clothing insulation, metabolic rate, air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, and air speed. Increasing air speed enhances heat transfer via convection and evaporation, which provides a cooling sensation named “[Cooling Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal\_comfort#Cooling\_Effect)”. It allows the body to maintain thermal comfort at higher air temperatures than what would be comfortable in still air. Figure T1 shows how the air speed is associated with cooling effect. More importantly, this cooling effect is instantaneous and beneficial during the transitional moments (i.e., stepping into the building from hot and humid outdoor environment). The ASHRAE Standard 55 (2020) and the [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool](https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/) both help to design how much air movement is needed for thermal comfort and occupant satisfaction.

### Thermal comfort calculation with elevated air speed <a href="#_toc584284653" id="_toc584284653"></a>

ASHRAE Standard 55 (2020) provides a method called The Elevated Air Speed Comfort to calculate thermal comfort in situations of elevated air speed. This method uses a combination of the Analytical Comfort Zone Method combined with the [Standard Effective Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal\_comfort#Standard\_effective\_temperature) (SET) method. The SET output translates the six thermal comfort factors (from above) into a single temperature equivalent that can be compared across a variety of comfort conditions. In addition, the cooling effect initiates by increased air speed is also used to calculate the Cooling Fan Efficiency (CFE). CFE is defined in [ASHRAE Standard 216 (2020)](https://www.techstreet.com/standards/ashrae-216-2020?product\_id=2202077) as the ratio of the cooling effect to the input power of the fan. CFE gives people a standardized way to compare how much cooling a fan provides when consuming the same amount of energy.

### Human response to air movement <a href="#_toc1726195060" id="_toc1726195060"></a>

Do the occupants prefer an environment with cooler temperature or one with an increased air speed and slightly higher temperature? Research has shown that people prefer an environment where they can use fans with a slightly higher than usual temperature (i.e., 26 °C \[79 °F]) compared with the typical air conditioning temperature setpoint (i.e., 23 °C \[73 °F]) without fans ([ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ina.12352)). Studies conducted in office buildings showed that the results were aligned with the findings obtained from laboratory experiments ([ref](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.03.013)). In addition, using the human heat balance model, a study found that fans can be used to safely cool occupants even if the ambient temperature exceeded normal skin temperature (i.e., 35 °C \[95 °F]) ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321008325)).

### Fan options and considerable metrics <a href="#_toc2046145642" id="_toc2046145642"></a>

There are multiple fan types available in the market, but ceiling fans in general out-weigh its benefits over other fan types due to its air circulation effectiveness and low energy consumption, especially for serving multiple occupants within the same space. In addition, installation and operation of ceiling fans are specific to building design which is different from other portable fan options. This guide highlights a standalone section on ceiling fans, while other fan choices (i.e., other air movement devices) will be discussed in separate section.

## Ceiling fans <a href="#_toc86166506" id="_toc86166506"></a>

The US Department of Energy (DOE) defines a variety of ceiling fan types in the "Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Ceiling Fans". Table T1 presents the criteria of ceiling fan blade thickness and tip speed adopted from DOE, and Table T2 summarizes the definition of several common ceiling fan types with supporting remarks.

| Airflow Direction | Thickness (t) of edges of blades | Tip speed threshold |      |      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| mm                | in                               | m/s                 | fpm  |      |
| Downward-Only     | 4.8 > t ≥ 3.2                    | 3/16 > t ≥ 1/8      | 16.3 | 3200 |
| Downward-Only     | t ≥ 4.8                          | t ≥ 3/16            | 20.3 | 4000 |

| Reversible        | t ≥ 4.8                          | t ≥ 3/16            | 16.3 | 3200 |

Table T2. Common ceiling fan types (adapted from DOE definitions)

| Ceiling fan types       | Fan diameter (D) | Remarks     |                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| m                       | Ft               |             |                                                                                         |
| Standard fan            | 0.46 ≤ D ≤ 2.1   | 1.5 ≤ D ≤ 7 | Blade to ceiling height > 25 cm \[10 in]                                                |
| Large-diameter fan      | D > 2.1          | D > 7       | Known as high volume low speed (HVLS) fan                                               |
| Hugger fan              | 0.46 ≤ D ≤ 2.1   | 1.5 ≤ D ≤ 7 | <p>Similar to standard fan;</p><p>Blade to ceiling height ≤ 25 cm [10 in]</p>           |
| Very-small-diameter fan | D < 0.46         | D < 1.5     | <p>Airflow > 0.87 m³/s [1840 cfm];</p><p>Rotational speed > 90 rpm at highest speed</p> |

In general, a larger diameter fan (i.e., high volume low speed (HVLS) fan) blade can move a larger volume of air than a smaller diameter fan blade. As fan diameter increases, rotational speed is typically limited to prevent excessive noise from the fan blades, especially near the blade tip. Additionally, where fans can be mounted at blade heights below 3 m \[10 ft], the rotational speed must be limited to meet safety criteria for the maximum speed of the blade tips. HSLV fans require higher ceilings (typically at least 3.3 m \[11 ft]) and larger spaces free from obstructions to accommodate their increased diameter, and these fans are most often found in non-residential stings, like commercial and industrial applications. Some large-diameter ceiling fans include “winglets” or blade tip fences to maximize airflow and minimize noise, which is a less common problem in standard fans as the blade tip speed is already constrained for safety reasons.

### Fan blades <a href="#_toc401145334" id="_toc401145334"></a>

Blade shape, number of blades, and blade pitch are important factors in increasing energy efficiency while maximizing airflow through the fan blades. In general, there are two main types of fan blades: flat blade and airfoil-style blade. The curvature of the airfoil blades helps increase airflow through the ceiling fan, minimizing air turbulence at the trailing edge, which it is more efficient and quieter when compared to flat blades. However, airfoil blades will not operate as efficiently (i.e., lower airflow) in reverse direction. Increasing number of fan blades and blade’s angle will increase the airflow of ceiling fan. Nevertheless, the increased weight and drag can cause energy efficiency loss. Standard ceiling fan typically have 3 to 5 blades with blade’s angle to be 8 – 15°.

### Motors and drives <a href="#_toc1444095927" id="_toc1444095927"></a>

Typically, ceiling fans have three main types of motor (AC induction; permanent magnet DC (PMDC); and brushless direct current (DC) motors), and two types of drives (direct drive; and gear-driven). Table T3 highlights the characteristics of these motors and drives.

They typically provide only three speed levels.                         |
| Permanent magnet DC (PMDC)    | More energy efficient than AC motors and provides constant force over a wider range of speeds than AC motors.                                          |                                                                                                                                         |
| Brushless direct current (DC) | The most energy efficient of the three motor types (use 70% less energy than an AC motor), most quiet, and has a longer service life than PMDC motors. |                                                                                                                                         |

| Gear-driven                   | Gear-driven fans allow for higher motor power where maximizing airflow is a priority over sound levels or aesthetics.                                  |                                                                                                                                         |
