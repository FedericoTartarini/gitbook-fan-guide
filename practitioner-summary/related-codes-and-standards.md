### Related codes and standards <a href="#_toc137824723" id="_toc137824723"></a>

This technical guide does not cover all codes and standards that are related to fans and air movement published worldwide, it highlights only several commonly used materials for references and examples. It is also noted that the usage of these materials could be subjected to variations by countries. Users are advised to implement these materials with caution.

### Environmental conditions <a href="#_toc137824724" id="_toc137824724"></a>

[ASHRAE Standard 55 – Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/standard-55-thermal-environmental-conditions-for-human-occupancy) (2020) identifies factors that may affect thermal comfort in an indoor environment. Proposed in ASHRAE 55, the standard effective temperature (SET) is a reliable index in estimating heat loss effect for increased air speed condition. Check this (link to long guide) for details.

Green Mark is a green building certification scheme established in Singapore to raise standards in energy performance and emphasis on other sustainability outcomes. [A Technical Guide of Green Mark for existing non-residential buildings (2017)](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/docs/default-source/docs-corp-buildsg/sustainability/green-mark-enrb-2017-technical-guide\_\(11feb2020\)-to-upload708672f9aeaf4cb58ceb01298bd1de70.pdf?sfvrsn=8ada0ddf\_0%E3%80%81) suggests the indoor temperature setpoint could maintain at 26 °C \[79 °F] or above if the space is designed with elevated air speed.

### Ceiling fans testing regulations <a href="#_ceiling_fans_testing" id="_ceiling_fans_testing"></a>

[ASHRAE Standard 216 – Methods of Test for Determining Application Data of Overhead Circulator Fans (2020)](https://www.techstreet.com/ashrae/standards/ashrae-216-2020?gateway\_code=ashrae\&product\_id=2202077) specifies the instrumentation, facilities, test installation methods, and procedures to determine ceiling fan application data for occupant thermal comfort in a space. Check this (link to long guide) for details.

Performance testing on small-diameter ceiling fans (≤ 2.1 m \[7 ft]) is recommended by the [ENERGY STAR qualified method](https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod\_development/revisions/downloads/ceil\_fans/testmanual.pdf). Check this (link to long guide) for details.

Performance testing on large-diameter ceiling fans (> 2.1 m \[7 ft]) is standardized by the [Air Movement and Control Association (AMCA) Standard 230 – Laboratory Methods of Testing Air Circulating Fans for Rating and Certification (2015)](https://www.techstreet.com/amca/standards/amca-230-15?product\_id=1904250). Check this (link to long guide) for details.

A modified testing method for large-diameter fans, the [ceiling fan Energy Index (CFEI)](https://www.amca.org/assets/resources/public/assets/uploads/Introducing\_Ceiling\_Fan\_Energy\_Index\_2.pdf), is developed to enhance ceiling fan testing effectiveness. CFEI is derived from the fan energy index equation in [_ANSI/AMCA Standard 208-18: Calculation of the Fan Energy Index_](https://www.amca.org/news/press-releases/ansi/amca-standard-208,-calculation-of-the-fan-energy-index,-available-for-free-download.html) with substitute coefficient for large-diameter ceiling fans. Check this (link to long guide) for details.

### Fire safety <a href="#_toc137824726" id="_toc137824726"></a>

The primary concern with ceiling fans in relation to the fire code is the interaction with fire sprinklers. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards, [NFPA 13](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=13), summarizes the requirements of ceiling fans installation with respect to fire sprinklers in buildings. It is noted that specific fire safety requirements may vary by country, users should always consult local codes and requirements for a specific project.

### Seismic requirements <a href="#_toc137824727" id="_toc137824727"></a>

Seismic considerations and requirements are especially relevant for installations of ceiling fans, especially for large-diameter fans, long suspension rods, or other requirements for seismic support. An example can be found in the [American Society of Civil Engineer (ASCE 7) Standard](https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/asce-7). Users should always consult local codes and requirements for a specific project.
