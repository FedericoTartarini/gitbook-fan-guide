## Introduction

This guide enables engineers, architects, and facility managers to maximize the many benefits of fans and integrating fans (also known as elevated air movement devices) into HVAC systems. It introduces the advantages of using fans, describes how they work, explains how to select them, and provides guidance and resources for designing spaces with fans in buildings.

The key benefits of fans are as follows:

* Thermal comfort: Increased air movement across the skin remove heat from the body by convection and evaporation. Given the ability of some fans to provide more personalized thermal conditions, they can increase comfort.
* Improved air distribution: Operation of fans supports the HVAC system to increase air mixing, providing more uniform temperature and air quality distribution throughout a space in both heating and cooling conditions.
* Improved indoor air quality: Increased air speed may reduce an occupant’s exposure to indoor pollutants via dilution of the concentration of local sources, enhancement of the deposition rate of airborne particles onto indoor surfaces and increased ultraviolet germicidal irradiation system (UVGI) effectiveness for disinfection.
* Energy savings: Fans incur significant energy savings by reducing cooling demand of the HVAC system when the indoor temperature setpoints are increased. The HVAC savings potential is about two-orders of magnitude above the fan energy use.
* Cost savings: Beside the cost savings related to energy savings, using ceiling fans to distribute air more effectively throughout a space can reduce ductwork and diffusers required to serve a zone. Additionally, the higher temperature cooling setting allows HVAC system size reduction for chiller and air handling units, thus reducing the capital cost.

### How air speed meets thermal comfort goals <a href="#_toc618460869" id="_toc618460869"></a>

ASHRAE Standard 55 – Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy (2020) ([ref](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/bookstore/standard-55-thermal-environmental-conditions-for-human-occupancy)) identifies six factors that affect thermal comfort, including clothing insulation, metabolic rate, air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity, and air speed. Increasing air speed enhances heat transfer via convection and evaporation, which provides a cooling sensation named “[Cooling Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal\_comfort#Cooling\_Effect)”. It allows the body to maintain thermal comfort at higher air temperatures than what would be comfortable in still air. Figure T1 shows how the air speed is associated with cooling effect. More importantly, this cooling effect is instantaneous and beneficial during the transitional moments (i.e., stepping into the building from hot and humid outdoor environment). The ASHRAE Standard 55 (2020) and the [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool](https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/) both help to design how much air movement is needed for thermal comfort and occupant satisfaction.

### Thermal comfort calculation with elevated air speed <a href="#_toc584284653" id="_toc584284653"></a>

ASHRAE Standard 55 (2020) provides a method called The Elevated Air Speed Comfort to calculate thermal comfort in situations of elevated air speed. This method uses a combination of the Analytical Comfort Zone Method combined with the [Standard Effective Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal\_comfort#Standard\_effective\_temperature) (SET) method. The SET output translates the six thermal comfort factors (from above) into a single temperature equivalent that can be compared across a variety of comfort conditions. In addition, the cooling effect initiates by increased air speed is also used to calculate the Cooling Fan Efficiency (CFE). CFE is defined in [ASHRAE Standard 216 (2020)](https://www.techstreet.com/standards/ashrae-216-2020?product\_id=2202077) as the ratio of the cooling effect to the input power of the fan. CFE gives people a standardized way to compare how much cooling a fan provides when consuming the same amount of energy.

### Human response to air movement <a href="#_toc1726195060" id="_toc1726195060"></a>

Do the occupants prefer an environment with cooler temperature or one with an increased air speed and slightly higher temperature? Research has shown that people prefer an environment where they can use fans with a slightly higher than usual temperature (i.e., 26 °C \[79 °F]) compared with the typical air conditioning temperature setpoint (i.e., 23 °C \[73 °F]) without fans ([ref](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ina.12352)). Studies conducted in office buildings showed that the results were aligned with the findings obtained from laboratory experiments ([ref](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.03.013)). In addition, using the human heat balance model, a study found that fans can be used to safely cool occupants even if the ambient temperature exceeded normal skin temperature (i.e., 35 °C \[95 °F]) ([ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321008325)).

## Fan options and considerable metrics <a href="#_toc2046145642" id="_toc2046145642"></a>

There are multiple fan types available in the market, but ceiling fans in general out-weigh its benefits over other fan types due to its air circulation effectiveness and low energy consumption, especially for serving multiple occupants within the same space. In addition, installation and operation of ceiling fans are specific to building design which is different from other portable fan options. This guide highlights a standalone section on ceiling fans, while other fan choices (i.e., other air movement devices) will be discussed in separate section.

### Ceiling fans <a href="#_toc86166506" id="_toc86166506"></a>

The US Department of Energy (DOE) defines a variety of ceiling fan types in the "Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Ceiling Fans". Table T1 presents the criteria of ceiling fan blade thickness and tip speed adopted from DOE, and Table T2 summarizes the definition of several common ceiling fan types with supporting remarks.

Table T1. Ceiling Fan Blade and Tip Speed Criteria (adapted from DOE definitions).

| Airflow Direction | Thickness (t) of edges of blades | Tip speed threshold |      |      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| mm                | in                               | m/s                 | fpm  |      |
| Downward-Only     | 4.8 > t ≥ 3.2                    | 3/16 > t ≥ 1/8      | 16.3 | 3200 |
| Downward-Only     | t ≥ 4.8                          | t ≥ 3/16            | 20.3 | 4000 |
| Reversible        | 4.8 > t ≥ 3.2                    | 3/16 > t ≥ 1/8      | 12.2 | 2400 |
| Reversible        | t ≥ 4.8                          | t ≥ 3/16            | 16.3 | 3200 |

Table T2. Common ceiling fan types (adapted from DOE definitions)

| Ceiling fan types       | Fan diameter (D) | Remarks     |                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| m                       | Ft               |             |                                                                                         |
| Standard fan            | 0.46 ≤ D ≤ 2.1   | 1.5 ≤ D ≤ 7 | Blade to ceiling height > 25 cm \[10 in]                                                |
| Large-diameter fan      | D > 2.1          | D > 7       | Known as high volume low speed (HVLS) fan                                               |
| Hugger fan              | 0.46 ≤ D ≤ 2.1   | 1.5 ≤ D ≤ 7 | <p>Similar to standard fan;</p><p>Blade to ceiling height ≤ 25 cm [10 in]</p>           |
| Very-small-diameter fan | D < 0.46         | D < 1.5     | <p>Airflow > 0.87 m³/s [1840 cfm];</p><p>Rotational speed > 90 rpm at highest speed</p> |

In general, a larger diameter fan (i.e., high volume low speed (HVLS) fan) blade can move a larger volume of air than a smaller diameter fan blade. As fan diameter increases, rotational speed is typically limited to prevent excessive noise from the fan blades, especially near the blade tip. Additionally, where fans can be mounted at blade heights below 3 m \[10 ft], the rotational speed must be limited to meet safety criteria for the maximum speed of the blade tips. HSLV fans require higher ceilings (typically at least 3.3 m \[11 ft]) and larger spaces free from obstructions to accommodate their increased diameter, and these fans are most often found in non-residential stings, like commercial and industrial applications. Some large-diameter ceiling fans include “winglets” or blade tip fences to maximize airflow and minimize noise, which is a less common problem in standard fans as the blade tip speed is already constrained for safety reasons.

#### Fan blades <a href="#_toc401145334" id="_toc401145334"></a>

Blade shape, number of blades, and blade pitch are important factors in increasing energy efficiency while maximizing airflow through the fan blades. In general, there are two main types of fan blades: flat blade and airfoil-style blade. The curvature of the airfoil blades helps increase airflow through the ceiling fan, minimizing air turbulence at the trailing edge, which it is more efficient and quieter when compared to flat blades. However, airfoil blades will not operate as efficiently (i.e., lower airflow) in reverse direction. Increasing number of fan blades and blade’s angle will increase the airflow of ceiling fan. Nevertheless, the increased weight and drag can cause energy efficiency loss. Standard ceiling fan typically have 3 to 5 blades with blade’s angle to be 8 – 15°.

#### Motors and drives <a href="#_toc1444095927" id="_toc1444095927"></a>

Typically, ceiling fans have three main types of motor (AC induction; permanent magnet DC (PMDC); and brushless direct current (DC) motors), and two types of drives (direct drive; and gear-driven). Table T3 highlights the characteristics of these motors and drives.

Table T3. Comparison between ceiling fan’s motors and drives

| Motors                        | Alternating current (AC) induction                                                                                                                     | Provides constant, even airflow and are cheaper than DC motors. They typically provide only three speed levels.                         |
| Permanent magnet DC (PMDC)    | More energy efficient than AC motors and provides constant force over a wider range of speeds than AC motors.                                          |                                                                                                                                         |
| Brushless direct current (DC) | The most energy efficient of the three motor types (use 70% less energy than an AC motor), most quiet, and has a longer service life than PMDC motors. |                                                                                                                                         |

| Gear-driven                   | Gear-driven fans allow for higher motor power where maximizing airflow is a priority over sound levels or aesthetics.                                  |                                                                                                                                         |

#### Diameter and rotational speed <a href="#_toc446846141" id="_toc446846141"></a>

Assume all other factors being equal, a larger diameter fan will produce greater airflow, average air speed, and uniformity of air speed in space than a smaller diameter fan at the same rotational speed. In general, the total airflow and the air speed form any measurement point are linear with rotational speed. This relationship begins to break down at very low air speed, very low rotational speeds, or where the fan blade height is unusually far from the floor.

#### Rated airflow <a href="#_toc748789084" id="_toc748789084"></a>

The test methods for rating the airflow of these fans are regulated in the US under 10 CFR 430 Appendix U ([ref](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appU)). For standard fans, the rating is determined by a modified Energy Star method ([ref](https://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod\_development/revisions/downloads/ceil\_fans/testmanual.pdf)), while for large diameter fans (above 2.1 m \[7ft]), the rating is determined by the AMCA 230-15 test method ([ref](https://www.techstreet.com/amca/standards/amca-230-15?product\_id=1904250)).

#### Air speed and uniformity <a href="#_toc1420574299" id="_toc1420574299"></a>

Ceiling fans air speed is defined as the average air speed that passes through the fan blades sweeping area. It is calculated by dividing the rated airflow of the fan by its diameter. Fan air speed is a useful metric because it is more directly representative of the air speed that will occur in the space. Typically, the maximum air speed in the space is within 1.3 – 1.5 times of the fan air speed and will occur below the fan blade tip. Fans with higher maximum fan rotational speed will produce higher possible air speed in the room regardless of fan diameter. This means that if the room design target is based on maximum air speed instead of rated airflow, the designer can directly compare between fans with different size.

The variation of the air speeds in a space is an important design consideration. Figure T2 demonstrates an example of air speeds distribution from a 1.5 m \[5 ft] diameter ceiling fan. The airflow ‘jet’ from the fan immediately narrows to a slightly smaller diameter than the fan blades. The jet then impinges on the floor, creating a stagnation point, and then spreads radially outwards along the floor. Away from the fan diameter and above the floor spreading zone, there is a still air zone where air speeds are almost unaffected. The depth of air spreading zone along the floor and its average air speed is dependent to the fan diameter: smaller fan (shallower) and larger fan (deeper). In general, larger diameter fans have lower air speeds directly under the fan centre (i.e., near the stagnation point), but the air speeds distribution is more uniform than the smaller diameter fans.

#### Fan operates in reverse direction <a href="#_toc1637818677" id="_toc1637818677"></a>

Most of the ceiling fan in the market can operate in reverse direction (i.e., blowing air upwards). One application is destratifying spaces in the heating season, where downwards flow may cause a draft (overcooling) on the occupants even when the fan is operating as minimum rotational speed. The air circulation pattern generated by reversely operated ceiling fans is similar to the normal operation condition, but the air speed is much lower and much more uniformly distributed in space. The upward blowing airflow is depended on the fan type and blade geometry. For the same diameter fans, fan with flat blades would generate higher upward airflow than airfoil-style blade. The average air speed for upwards blowing is approximately 60 – 70 % of the downwards case for flat blades fans. Furniture and ceiling obstructions are likely contributing to the drop of airflow.

#### Fans speed control <a href="#_toc127199579" id="_toc127199579"></a>

Most standard fans typically have several fixed fan speed levels. Standard AC motor fans typically have 3 levels, whereas DC motor fans tend to have more. Large diameter fans are typically variable speed regardless of motor type. Having a high minimum speed can be problematic in some applications, it may generate too much of a cooling effect for the occupants when temperatures are mild or cool. A reasonable approximation is that the minimum fan air speed should be below 0.4 m/s \[80 fpm], or a 1.7 °C \[3 °F] cooling effect at the minimum allowed blade height, depending on the specifics of the application.

#### Power and efficacy <a href="#_toc1225658860" id="_toc1225658860"></a>

According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), ceiling fan efficacy is generally defined by the amount of airflow generated by the fan divided by the power consumption. Typical fans efficacy at the lowest and highest operating speeds are, respectively, 0.08 m³/s·W \[165 CFM/W] and 0.04 m³/s·W \[79 CFM/W] (ref: MAEDbS dataset). It is noted that ceiling fans with the same efficacy could perform differently, where fans with lower-rated maximum airflows will have a better-rated efficacy even if they consume more power to provide the same airflow. It is because when a fan operates at lower rotation speed, the reduction of power consumption is higher than airflow (i.e., fan power ∝ (rotational speed)3, while airflow ∝ rotational speed), resulting in higher fan efficacy metrics (airflow/power). Figure T8 shows three fans have the same efficacy 0.11 m³/s·W \[234 CFM/W], but the fan represented by the left most curve has a smaller overall efficiency (i.e., lowest maximum airflow) than the right most curve (i.e., highest maximum airflow).

Meanwhile, the ceiling fan energy index (CFEI), a ratio of reference fan power input to actual fan power input, is a more reliable alternative in reflecting the above blind spot. It helps to make inefficient fans less likely to comply with slower speeds and to remove the unintentional barrier to compliance for high-performing high-utility fans by comparing fans to a standardized baseline. Taken the same example in Figure T3, CFEI at high fan speed for the left most and right most curve is, respectively, 0.63 (less efficient) and 1.72 (more efficient). See section “Ceiling fans testing regulations” for more information.

Figure T3. Fan efficacy versus total airflow and power.

Generally, the ability of a fan to operate efficiently at lower speed improves as the diameter increases, but there is considerable variation in performance between models of fans with the same diameter. Fans with a lower turndown ratio (i.e., minimum fan speed divided by maximum fan speed) can be more flexible in different applications purpose.

### Other air movement devices <a href="#_toc1434760116" id="_toc1434760116"></a>

Places with lower floor-to-ceiling height or a ceiling with compacted fixtures could be limited for ceiling fan installation. Moreover, installing a ceiling fan may be challenging due to the presence of other equipment like lights. These limitations can be mitigated by using other air movement devices. There are numerous kinds of fan available in the market, this technical guide only illustrates six common types of air movement devices: desk fan, pedestal fan, tower fan, wall mounted fan, bladeless ceiling fan, and air circulator. The selection criteria of these fan types are discussed as follows.

#### Typical functions and airflow patterns <a href="#_toc694134462" id="_toc694134462"></a>

The above-mentioned air movement devices basically have two major functions: (1) move air directly towards human body and (2) room air circulation. Moving air towards human body aims to cool the subject by means of convective heat loss, while air circulation aims to keep air in motion within the enclosed space to enhance air and temperature mixing. Nevertheless, most of the fan types can deliver both functions by adjusting the fan speed and operation distance between fans and occupants. Therefore, fan selection should be based on the intend whether it is individual adjustment for personal cooling (group 1) or produce a general air movement effect for multiple occupants’ usage simultaneously. Table T4 summarizes the typical function, application location, and approximate price range of different fan types for references.

Table T4. Summary of other air movement device’s function, noise level and approximate price range.

| Fan Type                  | Typical function                                       | Typical application location                                   | Price range (USD) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Desk fan                  | Air movement towards human body                        | Workstation, bedroom, study room                               | $ 10 - $ 300      |
| Pedestal fan              | Air movement towards human body / Room air circulation | Open plan office, residence                                    | $ 40 - $ 400      |
| Tower fan                 | Air movement towards human body / Room air circulation | Bedroom, personal office, small room                           | $ 40 - $ 450      |
| Wall mounted fan          | Air movement towards human body / Room air circulation | Residence, waiting room, restaurant, school, warehouse         | $ 50 - $ 300      |
| Bladeless ceiling fan     | Room air circulation                                   | Residence, office                                              | $ 500 - $ 1000    |
| Air circulator            | Room air circulation                                   | Warehouse, residence, open plan office                         | $ 50 - $ 300      |
| Ceiling fan (with blades) | Air movement towards human body / Room air circulation | Any indoor / semi-indoor space with sufficient mounting height | $ 200 - $ 1000    |

Airflow patterns from different devices can be varied by fan size, blade types, and fan structure. Currently, there is no requirement or standard on typical air speed for the air movement devices described in Table T4. The air speed and airflow requirements are mainly dependent to the typical functions and locations of usage.

For fans that intend for direct cooling towards human body, customers tend to select a stronger fan which can produce more airflow and faster air speed. However, in some situations (e.g., operating fan together with air-conditioning), the occupants do not require air movement that is too strong. Therefore, choosing a fan with possible lower airflow turndown (minimum speed divided by maximum speed) capability could be the key for better comfort in terms of direct convective cooling. Meanwhile, if the function of a fan is used to circulate the air with a room, the fan selection approach should be either bigger in size (i.e., produce more airflow) or able to generate high airflow jet with high speed to drive the in-room air. Figure T4 illustrates the examples of airflow flow patterns for different fan types.

#### Noise levels <a href="#_toc1308291521" id="_toc1308291521"></a>

Noise from a fan can initiate dissatisfaction and unwillingness of its usage from occupants. The noise sources of a fan are mainly from the operating motor and the fast movements of the blades (i.e., turbulence ingestion). Sound level of domestic fans ranges from 30 to 70 dBA. Fans operate at higher speeds usually correspond to higher noise level due to turbulence. Nevertheless, the noise cannot be characterized only by sound level, its frequency is also an important aspect. Low frequency noise has been identified to be annoying. It is not practical to conclude one fan type will always be quieter than another. Designers/users are encouraged to experience the fan usage before purchasing.

#### Power and cooling fan efficiency <a href="#_toc893574060" id="_toc893574060"></a>

All the elevated air movement devices described in Table T4 consist of motor and drive. The types of motor and drive used for these elevated air movement devices are similar to that operate in a ceiling fan, which we have been discussed in the former section. It is worth noted that, larger energy saving potential can be achieved by using DC motor instead of AC motor, especially for small fans like desk fan or pedestal fan.

In general, fan performance can be evaluated by the cooling fan efficiency (CFE) index, ratio between cooling effect of the device and its power consumption, defines in following equation (where _Pf_ is the input power of the fan (in W) and ∆_teq_ is the whole-body cooling effect (in °C or °F)):

It is noted that the cooling effect depends on the effectiveness of convective cooling towards subject’s body, and is affected by air speed, airflow pattern, and fan operation distance. Eventually, the intent of fan usage (local cooling vs air circulation) should have been taken into consideration when quantifying the fan effectiveness.

#### Flexibility and other features <a href="#_toc83950707" id="_toc83950707"></a>

One major advantage of the above listed elevated air movement devices over ceiling fan is the high flexibility of usage in terms of location, operation height and oscillating angle. Such flexibility enhances adjustment to occupant’s needs and comfort demand regarding elevated air speed under different circumstances.

In addition, some fans are also equipped with modern technologies that enable them with special features while being equally efficient. For example, fans equipped with filters for air purification, fans installed with UV-C light for air disinfection, and fans that emit water mist for air humidification and evaporative cooling.

### Designing air movement in space <a href="#_toc518571071" id="_toc518571071"></a>

Fans are effective for comfort cooling and air circulation. However, fan applications are highly dependent on the design intent for desire air speed and distribution, and any physical environment limitations. Understanding the elevated air movement design intent is the prerequisite in selecting an adequate fan type for a particular space.

### Design intents <a href="#_toc1666972090" id="_toc1666972090"></a>

Figure T5 outlines the key considerations for defining the fan design intents, including personal control, targeted, variability, and uniformity. “Personal control” design emphasizes the goal of fan system to provide thermal comfort for a single occupant, while the adjustment of fans is unlikely affecting the others. “Variability” has its advantage at multi-occupant space where occupants have flexibility to adjust fans operation based on their desire thermal comfort needs, or they are free to move around and choose their preferrable locations or thermal conditions. In spaces where there is variable or transient occupancies, non-uniform thermal conditions, or spaces with specific thermal requirements due to architectural features or activity levels, “Targeted” air movement may provide more comfort. Lastly, “Uniformity” (i.e., more regular control) emphasizes uniform air speeds and consistent thermal comfort experience applied in multi-occupant spaces where occupants do not have flexibility to control fan or change their location, especially when occupants will be staying in those areas for extended periods.

### Fan type selection <a href="#_toc1936285678" id="_toc1936285678"></a>

Fan selection criteria are mainly dependent on design intent of air speed and distribution, purpose of elevated air movement (i.e., direct cooling across human body or air circulation), and any limitations of fan usage in space (i.e., floor to ceiling height).

In general, ceiling fans are effective for both comfort cooling and air circulation in nearly all scenarios and applications. Ceiling fans are recommended due to their effectiveness in air movement, provided that some limitations of implementation have been compromised, including insufficient height clearance for ceiling fans installation, presence of obstructions at ceiling or on the floor that block airflow, inadequate arrangement between lighting fixtures and ceiling fans that causes strobing or visual flickering effect, and high renovation cost for ceiling fans integrated design. Installation of ceiling fans is recommended if these limitations do not apply, alternatively other air movement devices shall be chosen if these limitations cannot be compromised. Figure T6 presents the fan selection examples (with / without ceiling fan) based on different design intents. In addition, different types of fans can be integrated to maximize occupants’ comfort and to achieve multiple design intents. For example, ceiling fans can provide a uniformly low speed background air movement for all occupants in a large open space, while individual fan allow additional personal control to further improve occupants’ local thermal comfort at whenever it is necessary (e.g., at transient condition or near the window). An example of such mixed design intent approach is presented in the bottom of Figure T6.

### Ceiling fan integration with HVAC system <a href="#_toc548991981" id="_toc548991981"></a>

This technical guide focuses on the integration of ceiling fan with air-conditioning system in building, due to higher attention on design, installation, and operation. Besides, incorporating ceiling fans in early system design stage can achieve additional saving in reduced construction cost and downsized HVAC system components.

### Ceiling fan system design <a href="#_toc1391810236" id="_toc1391810236"></a>

Considerations of ceiling fan design in space are mainly two folds: fan size and installation.

#### Fan size (and number) determination <a href="#_hlk129940953" id="_hlk129940953"></a>

Determining appropriate ceiling fan size (and number) within space is critical to air speed distribution and effective cooling. Table T5 lists the key features for fan size (and number) determination.

Figure T7 demonstrates an example of recommended ceiling fan size for single-fan applications. Provided that the room area aspect ratio (length : width) is within 1.5 : 1, one fan operation is applicable. The room area is 24 m2 \[258 ft2] and the characteristic width is 4.9 m \[16 ft] (i.e., square root of the room area). The recommended ceiling fan diameters are between 0.2 – 0.4 times of the room characteristics width, equivalent to 1 m \[3.3 ft] – 2 m \[6.6 ft], assuming all other features in Table T5 have been fulfilled.

Figure T7. Recommended ceiling fan size and layout for single-fan applications.

Figure T8 presents two examples of recommended ceiling fan size and layout for multi-fan applications with the same site area (240 m2 \[2580 ft2]) but different room heights and room functions. In Figure T8a shows a warehouse divided into two identical fan cells and one larger-diameter ceiling fan (4.4 m \[14 ft]) is centred in each fan cells. The design and installation are valid with sufficient room height (8 m \[26 ft]). In Figure T8b shows an office with the same area of the warehouse, but a much lower room height (2.6 m \[9 ft]). It also demonstrates two layout settings: less fan cells with larger fans (on the left) and more fan cells with smaller fans (on the right). Settings on the left has four 30 m2 \[322 ft2] fan cells and a 2.2 m \[7 ft] diameter fan centred in each cell (calculated by 0.4 time of room characteristics width). A 2.2 m \[7 ft] diameter fan is considered as larger-diameter ceiling fan, which requires at least 3 m \[10 ft] mounting height above floor level (see Table T5) and it is not suitable to be installed in office space with relatively shorter room height. In addition, considering this is an office space, too large fan size would block the lighting fixture on the ceiling, initiating unwanted visual flicker. Use of a smaller fan size may fulfil the installation requirement but result in smaller airflow rate and reduced uniformity. The layout settings on the right, with more but smaller fan cells (13 m2 \[140 ft2]) and a 1.45 m \[4.7 ft] diameter fan centred in each cell, can provide more uniform air speed within space and it is a more suitable design for office settings.

In general, all ceiling fan installation procedures shall follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ceiling fan should be fixed in a structural surface (slab or beam) to guarantee sturdiness and stability. With the appropriate type of mounting bracket, ceiling fans can also be installed in sloped ceiling. There is no reinforcement requirement if the diameter of fan is smaller than 2.1 m \[7 ft].

The fans mounting heights from ceiling / floor and clearance from walls / obstructions are important regarding both safety and performance consideration (See Table T5 in details for both standard and large diameter ceiling fans). In rule of thumb, ceiling fans require a minimum distance from the ceiling of 0.2 times of the fan diameter to avoid “starving”.

Installation of ceiling fans should avoid conflicts with the lighting fixtures to minimize changes of visual flicker and strobing effect, as well visual discomfort. Figure T9 illustrates the potential problems when ceiling fans interact with lighting fixtures. It suggests that visual flicker effect is dependent to view angle of the occupants. Thus, the position of ceiling fans should not only be installed away from the recess lights, but also considering occupants’ position in space. Alternatively, designer may consider the possibility of using dropdown lightings (see Figure T9c) with minimum glare to the occupants. If the above limitations with respect to lightings cannot be resolved, designers may consider using other non-ceiling fan alternatives.

Operation of ceiling fans near windows / doors opening would impact the room air changes per hour (ACH) or ventilation rate. Figure T10 illustrates the airflow patterns for normal window and door-like opening settings. Designers should consider the impact of room ACH via window in natural ventilation conditions by the fan airflow patterns. The use of door-like openings may induce more outdoor airflow.

### Air-conditioning system design <a href="#_toc2041678943" id="_toc2041678943"></a>

Conventional air-conditioning system requires diffusers and extended air ducts to distribute air evenly within the space. However, ceiling fans integrated with conventional air-conditioning systems can achieve effective mixing and re-distribute the room air without the need for extra diffusers and extended supply air ducts. In principle, ceiling fans integrate well with most ventilation settings that require air mixing, including radiant cooling systems. However, they are unfavourable for systems that rely on stratification, such as displacement ventilation and underfloor air distribution system or systems utilizing active or passive chilled beams.

Figure T11 compares the design layouts between a conventional air-conditioning system and a recommended ceiling fan integrated air-conditioning system. The ceiling fan integrated air-conditioning system requires only the main supply air duct to throw cool air from a high-sidewall vent into the occupied space. Then the ceiling fan will mix and distribute the cool air in the space. The cool supply air would be best fed above the fan blades to enhance air mixing and avoid cold draft. Immediate benefits of such design are reduced capital and maintenance costs for unnecessary ducting, diffusers, and variable air volume (VAV) boxes. In addition, the ceiling fans could work more efficiently with larger blades to ceiling height (assuming no false ceiling and without extra supply air duct).

### Ceiling fans integrated AC System <a href="#_toc1319731500" id="_toc1319731500"></a>

One major advantage of the integrated air movement design is the additional convective effects on occupants. This means that additional energy saving from space cooling is possible due to air-conditioning system optimization.

#### Design room conditions <a href="#_toc1662001613" id="_toc1662001613"></a>

The presence of space air movement allows higher dry bulb room temperature (2-3 °C \[4-5 °F]) and dewpoint temperature (1-2 °C \[2-4 °F]) when compared with conventional air-conditioning system design. Alternatively, if the original designated air temperature is 23-25 °C \[73-77 °F], it can be increased to 23-27 °C \[73-81 °F] with elevated air movement to achieve similar or even better thermal comfort. The room operating air speed can be up to 0.8 m/s \[160 fpm] without personal control, while there is no air speed limit if occupants have full control of the fans (i.e., just ceiling fan or ceiling fan + desk fan) within the space.

#### Components selection <a href="#_toc1211915321" id="_toc1211915321"></a>

Regarding the relaxation of designated cooling demand (i.e., lower sensible and latent load), the chiller and the air handling unit (AHU) from original HVAC system can be downsized in the system design stage. The design supply air temperature setpoint (SAT) and chilled water temperature (ChWT) setpoint relaxation should be 50% to 100% the zone cooling setpoint temperature adjustment. For example, if compared to a conventional HVAC design, the HVAC design with elevated air speed could have 2 °C higher cooling setpoint temperature, the SAT and ChWT setpoints should be increased by 1-2 °C. In addition, a smaller size fan in the AHU can be used for the ceiling fan integrated design, because it returns smaller static pressure along the critical supply air path (only require the main supply air duct).

#### HVAC and fans system control <a href="#_toc2055116101" id="_toc2055116101"></a>

Figure T12 demonstrates the control schematic for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system with and without the integration of ceiling fans. It shows that when ceiling fans are integrated with the building automation system (BAS), it can react at the first stage cooling setpoint (say 23 °C \[73 °F]) to cooling down the zone before the HVAC system beings to operate for cooling. The ceiling fan speed shall increase with the room temperature, which is determined by cooling effect or a representative point in space. The HVAC cooling starts when indoor temperature increases to the second stage of cooling setpoint (say 26 °C \[79 °F]). Operating the HVAC system at this higher cooling setpoint has significant energy savings potential.

Figure T12. Example HVAC control schematic with / without ceiling fans.

Some ceiling fans have onboard sensing and controls that allow fan speed and temperature automation without integration with the building automation systems (BAS). A lower cost, simpler alternative to automatically control the ceiling fan based on temperature is to use a relay to turn fan(s) on and off. The fans then operate at a fixed pre-set speed. Fans operation can also be tied to occupancy sensors in the zone, preventing unnecessary operation, energy use, and maintenance. In some cases, it may be beneficial to operate fans even when unoccupied, such as pre-cooling applications that benefit from increased convection from surfaces in the space due to the air movement generated by the fans.

#### Potential savings <a href="#_toc916088046" id="_toc916088046"></a>

Comparing the two designs in Figure T11, the ceiling fan integrated air-conditioning system could save up to 45% in capital construction cost when compared with the conventional system. These savings are mainly obtained from reduced ductwork, diffusers, VAV boxes, sensors, and controls. Savings can also be obtained from the extra time and workmanship for additional ducting and fittings installation. More importantly, the majority of these ducting and fittings are not reusable and become construction waste when the building is being demolished. The cost of purchasing and installing the ceiling fans in the space is low when compared to the above cost savings.

In addition, substantial energy for space cooling can be accrued when implementing the elevated air movement with higher temperature cooling strategy. Approximately 17 % of cooling energy saving can be achieved by increasing the cooling temperature setpoint from 22 °C \[72 °F] to 25 °C \[77 °F]. In such room temperature setpoint adjustment, higher chilled water supply temperature (10 °C \[50 °F]) can be used, instead of the conventional temperature setpoint (7 °C \[44.6 °F]), which it would account for approximately 12% of additional energy saving from the chiller. In a Singaporean zero energy building a 32% HVAC energy saving was obtained when the setpoint was increased from 24 \[75 °F] to 26.5°C \[80 °F]. These cooling energy savings are at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the energy used for ceiling fans operation in space.

### Practical transformation to fan integrated AC system <a href="#_toc1840390445" id="_toc1840390445"></a>

### User education <a href="#_toc336745370" id="_toc336745370"></a>

A key indicator of successful fan-integrated system is to ensure that occupants understand the purpose and to use the fans. In other words, occupants should be informed about the purpose and operation of the fans. Figure T18 shows an example of an information plaque to inform the fan usage priority – Fan cooling first approach – when occupants are feeling too warm.

### Implementation and adaptation <a href="#_toc1778465232" id="_toc1778465232"></a>

Occupants take time to adapt to the fan-integrated AC system at warmer temperatures and higher air speed environments. Depending on the site conditions and culture, a grace period for occupant adaptation may take up to 3 months. Any change in temperature cooling setpoint should be small, gradual, and following occupants’ comfort feedback. Despite studies showing occupants can be comfortable at a higher temperature condition with increased air speed, in practice, they may perceive thermal dissatisfaction with a sharp change in room temperature setpoint (e.g., from 23 °C to 27 °C \[73 °F to 81 °F]) without providing a grace period for adaptation. This is particularly important in building retrofits.

For a practical implementation of fan-integrated system, building facility managers are suggested to go slow, have patience and perseverance with the progressive transformation process. For example, if the thermal comfort analyses indicate it is possible to increase the air temperature cooling setpoint from 25 to 27 °C \[from 77 to 81 °F] at higher air speed condition with fans; in practice, the temperature setpoint shall be first increased to 26 °C \[79 °F] and maintained for at least two weeks for occupant adaptation before further increasing it to 27 °C \[81 °F]. In addition, occupants’ feedback to the indoor environment shall be continuously monitored during the transformation period. If a lot of thermal dissatisfaction votes have been received, a slightly lower air temperature setpoint should be used. For example, the temperature should be brought down to 25.5 °C \[78 °F] to be maintained for two weeks, then raised up to 26 °C \[79 °F] again and advice and training to the occupants about the use of fans should be provided.

Several studies have suggested that occupants can have higher tolerance to thermal discomfort when they are provided with control to their micro-environment. Regardless of specific building functions or design intents, allowance for personal control of the fan systems is recommended.
