# Designing air movement in space

Fans are effective for comfort cooling and air circulation. However, fan applications are highly dependent on the design intent for desire air speed and distribution, and any physical environment limitations. Understanding the elevated air movement design intent is the prerequisite in selecting an adequate fan type for a particular space.

## Design intents <a href="#_toc1666972090" id="_toc1666972090"></a>

Figure T5 outlines the key considerations for defining the fan design intents, including personal control, targeted, variability, and uniformity. “Personal control” design emphasizes the goal of fan system to provide thermal comfort for a single occupant, while the adjustment of fans is unlikely affecting the others. “Variability” has its advantage at multi-occupant space where occupants have flexibility to adjust fans operation based on their desire thermal comfort needs, or they are free to move around and choose their preferrable locations or thermal conditions. In spaces where there is variable or transient occupancies, non-uniform thermal conditions, or spaces with specific thermal requirements due to architectural features or activity levels, “Targeted” air movement may provide more comfort. Lastly, “Uniformity” (i.e., more regular control) emphasizes uniform air speeds and consistent thermal comfort experience applied in multi-occupant spaces where occupants do not have flexibility to control fan or change their location, especially when occupants will be staying in those areas for extended periods.

## Fan type selection <a href="#_toc1936285678" id="_toc1936285678"></a>

Fan selection criteria are mainly dependent on design intent of air speed and distribution, purpose of elevated air movement (i.e., direct cooling across human body or air circulation), and any limitations of fan usage in space (i.e., floor to ceiling height).

In general, ceiling fans are effective for both comfort cooling and air circulation in nearly all scenarios and applications. Ceiling fans are recommended due to their effectiveness in air movement, provided that some limitations of implementation have been compromised, including insufficient height clearance for ceiling fans installation, presence of obstructions at ceiling or on the floor that block airflow, inadequate arrangement between lighting fixtures and ceiling fans that causes strobing or visual flickering effect, and high renovation cost for ceiling fans integrated design. Installation of ceiling fans is recommended if these limitations do not apply, alternatively other air movement devices shall be chosen if these limitations cannot be compromised. Figure T6 presents the fan selection examples (with / without ceiling fan) based on different design intents. In addition, different types of fans can be integrated to maximize occupants’ comfort and to achieve multiple design intents. For example, ceiling fans can provide a uniformly low speed background air movement for all occupants in a large open space, while individual fan allow additional personal control to further improve occupants’ local thermal comfort at whenever it is necessary (e.g., at transient condition or near the window). An example of such mixed design intent approach is presented in the bottom of Figure T6.
