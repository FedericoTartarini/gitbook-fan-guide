# Practical transformation to fan integrated AC system

## User education <a href="#_toc336745370" id="_toc336745370"></a>

A key indicator of successful fan-integrated system is to ensure that occupants understand the purpose and to use the fans. In other words, occupants should be informed about the purpose and operation of the fans. Figure T18 shows an example of an information plaque to inform the fan usage priority – Fan cooling first approach – when occupants are feeling too warm.

## Implementation and adaptation <a href="#_toc1778465232" id="_toc1778465232"></a>

Occupants take time to adapt to the fan-integrated AC system at warmer temperatures and higher air speed environments. Depending on the site conditions and culture, a grace period for occupant adaptation may take up to 3 months. Any change in temperature cooling setpoint should be small, gradual, and following occupants’ comfort feedback. Despite studies showing occupants can be comfortable at a higher temperature condition with increased air speed, in practice, they may perceive thermal dissatisfaction with a sharp change in room temperature setpoint (e.g., from 23 °C to 27 °C \[73 °F to 81 °F]) without providing a grace period for adaptation. This is particularly important in building retrofits.

For a practical implementation of fan-integrated system, building facility managers are suggested to go slow, have patience and perseverance with the progressive transformation process. For example, if the thermal comfort analyses indicate it is possible to increase the air temperature cooling setpoint from 25 to 27 °C \[from 77 to 81 °F] at higher air speed condition with fans; in practice, the temperature setpoint shall be first increased to 26 °C \[79 °F] and maintained for at least two weeks for occupant adaptation before further increasing it to 27 °C \[81 °F]. In addition, occupants’ feedback to the indoor environment shall be continuously monitored during the transformation period. If a lot of thermal dissatisfaction votes have been received, a slightly lower air temperature setpoint should be used. For example, the temperature should be brought down to 25.5 °C \[78 °F] to be maintained for two weeks, then raised up to 26 °C \[79 °F] again and advice and training to the occupants about the use of fans should be provided.

Several studies have suggested that occupants can have higher tolerance to thermal discomfort when they are provided with control to their micro-environment. Regardless of specific building functions or design intents, allowance for personal control of the fan systems is recommended.
