The [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool](https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu/) is an online tool developed by the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley, which helps users define comfort zones at elevated air speeds according to ASHRAE Standard-55 and EN-16798 methodologies. More details on how the tool functions can be found in the online [User Guide](https://center-for-the-built-environment.gitbook.io/thermal-comfort-tool/documentation/ashrae-55.html).

## CBE Ceiling Fan Design Tool <a href="#_toc137824722" id="_toc137824722"></a>

The [Ceiling Fan Design Tool](https://centerforthebuiltenvironment.github.io/fan-tool/) is an online tool developed by the Center for the Built Environment at the University of California, Berkeley, which helps users determine optimal ceiling fan arrangements from the user-defined parameters, such as room dimensions and design air speed ranges. The tool can inform users about the estimated air speed, cooling effect, and air speed uniformity when compared between different fan layouts. More details on how the tool functions can be found in the online [User Guide](https://github.com/CenterForTheBuiltEnvironment/fan-tool/wiki/User-Guide).
